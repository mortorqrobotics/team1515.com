            <h1>WHY BECOME A SPONSOR?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p id="whyContent">Your contribution will help students be a part of a successful team, ensure the wellbeing of our robotics team for years to come, and spread STEM in our community. Not only will your contributions help our team, but they may have mutual benefits for you as well. You can help promote your business using our platform and putting your logo on our team apparel or robot. Donations will help children accomplish their dreams and reach their full potential in the field of robotics, help your company accomplish a sales goal, create strong business relationships, and build a positive image for your business. Overall, it is a cumulative benefit for both parties in the donation process, and you should receive returns on your business investments and your company will be marketed on both our social media platforms and you can do it on yours as well. </p>
