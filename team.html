                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/castle.jpg"><h2>John R. Castle II</h2><h3>Robotics Teacher</h2><p>I have been with the team for 4 years.  I am the guy who ensures we function like a well running machine.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/will.png" style="margin: auto; width: 100%;"><h2>Will Ferenc</h2><h3>Head Mentor</h2><p>Will has been involved as a mentor/volunteer with FRC since 2009 and with 1515 since 2017. He believes that FRC is the best way for high school students to gain practical engineering experience. Will is best known for his work in the aerospace industry, including development of Life Support Sensors and high performance Optical Modems. In the off-season he runs a small contract engineering and product design firm. Will holds a BS in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College and maintains a California PE.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/kyle.png" style="margin: auto; width: 100%;"><h2>Kyle Mozdzyn</h2><h3>Field Applications Engineer</h2><p>I initially got involved with FRC during the 2012 season as an official NI support resource and control systems advisor for Rebound Rumble. 2 years ago, I got the opportunity to work with 1515 and it reignited my passion for FRC, teaching, and building cool stuff. During build season I typically focus on prototyping and fabrication due to many years designing and building racecars, but also can help out with control systems and data collection. I think FRC is one of the premier learning experiences available at the high school level because it teaches an incredible number of technical, nontechnical, and life skills in a fun, passionate, team based environment. Love the privilege of working with 1515!</p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/scarlett.jpg"><h2>Scarlet Koller</h2><h3>Build Mentor</h2><p>I have so far helped out for one part of one season and am excited to be more involved in the new FRC season. I can see how important a learning experience FRC has been to all the members of the team and I find your ideas and enthusiasm incredibly impressive. As a systems engineer with an aerospace background working at NASA JPL, I'm hoping as a mentor to help with integration of different systems and how to anticipate issues with design and implementation before they arise. </p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/ellacox.jpg"><h2>Ella Cox</h2><h3>President</h3><p>I have been a member of the team and pit crew for 4 years. Before becoming president, I was the build specialist and safety captain. I am so proud to lead such as great team of amazing people and I hope to continue to encourage more girls to join FRC.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/ramer.jpeg"><h2>Eli Ramer</h2><h3>Vice president/District Liaison/Machine Specialist</h3><p>My name is Eli Ramer, a current junior and member of this robotics team since freshman year. This team has given me so much whether it be great experiences or friends to last a lifetime. I am honored and humbled to be able to serve as a leader this year. As Machine Specialist I ensure that our shop runs smoothly and all new students are aware of all the necessary information when using shop machines and machining overall. As District Liaison I am currently working on establishing robotics teams at all schools in our district so that we can have clear pathways all the way from Kindergarten to High School. I am looking forward to doing my best this year and go MorTorq!</p></li>
                <li><img class="ethanPic" src="Assets/Leaders/ethanstone.jpg"><h2>Ethan Stone</h2><h3>Electrical Specialist</h3><p>I am the programming specialist of robotics. I am a Junior and have been on the team for 3 years now. I help code the robot for competition and teach future team programmers. Robotics has greatly increased my skill as a programmer and taught me what working in a team feels like. I enjoy meeting new kinds of people and teams during competition.</p></li>

My role is to encourage students and mold their innovative minds. This is done through introducing real world business tactics & concepts that enable participants to go forward and initiate the transition of business ideas, into successful businesses. FRC has been influential by allowing me a degree of insight into the real world impact these young participants can enact today. The services and ideas discussed by students are not just inspiring and/or interesting, they are life impacting, world changing concepts and technology. Knowledge is power and the dissemination of knowledge has never, throughout history, been proliferated to such an extent as we see today. FRC is that platform that highlights this realization. </p></li>

It has truly changed my life and made me realize that I am interested in studying both STEM and Business. The hands-on experience I have gained by being in this class is unique and priceless. As President of Business, I have learned so much about teamwork, synergy, and the satisfaction of a job well done together. I look forward to the rest of the year and next year on this team! Go MorTorq!</p></li>
