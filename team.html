                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/Will.png" width=400 height=400 style="margin: auto;"><h2>Will Ferenc</h2><h3>Head Coach</h2><p>Will has been involved as a mentor/volunteer with FRC since 2009 and with 1515 since 2017. He believes that FRC is the best way for high school students to gain practical engineering experience. Will is best known for his work in the aerospace industry, including development of Life Support Sensors and high performance Optical Modems. In the off-season he runs a small contract engineering and product design firm. Will holds a BS in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College and maintains a California PE.</p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/Scarlett.JPG"><h2>Scarlet Koller</h2><h3>Build Mentor</h2><p>I have so far helped out for one part of one season and am excited to be more involved in the new FRC season. I can see how important a learning experience FRC has been to all the members of the team and I find your ideas and enthusiasm incredibly impressive. As a systems engineer with an aerospace background working at NASA JPL, I'm hoping as a mentor to help with integration of different systems and how to anticipate issues with design and implementation before they arise. </p></li>
                <li><img src="Assets/Leaders/Katz.jpeg"><h2>Eli Katz</h2><h3>Build President</h2><p>3 years on the team. MorTorq has been such an incredible team and opportunity for me to learn teamwork, leadership, and engineering design. After being CAD Specialist for a year, I became President of the team. Iâ€™m so proud to be leading such an important organization, and I hope I leave the team in a stronger place for next year.</p></li>

This team has given me so much whether it be great experiences or friends to last a lifetime. I am honored and humbled to be able to serve as a leader this year. As Machine Specialist I ensure that our shop runs smoothly and all new students are aware of all the necessary information when using shop machines and machining overall. As District Liaison I am currently working on establishing robotics teams at all schools in our district so that we can have clear pathways all the way from Kindergarten to High School. I am looking forward to doing my best this year and go MorTorq!</p></li>

This team has been very important to my high school career as I have met many of my closest friends through this program. This year I hope to foster a sense of teamwork so that our newest members can develop the same kind of friendships that I value so highly, as well as to create a great robot that dominates the competition.  I am looking forward to another year of excitement, fun, and robotics. Go MORTORQ!</p></li>
